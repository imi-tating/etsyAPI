# etsyAPI


#MVP: the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea. Think bare essentials.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
1. Etsy shop owners
2. friends of Etsy shop owners
3. potential Etsy shoppers

GOAL:
1. to brighten up a show owners day
2. to give a potential shopper an quick overview of a shop/shop owner

ESSENTIAL USER STORIES:
1. as a shop owner, I want to be able to quickly, easily look back on old reviews to get a general view of my shop's perception
2. as a potential shopper, I want to quickly peruse a shops reviews for a general overview of the shops NPS
3. as a shop owners friend, I want to be able to quickly capture a feeling my friend's shop gives and then have a way to share that with the shop owner to brighten their day (this might be a step beyond MVP)
